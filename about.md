title: A Certain Laboratory for a Certain Person

Once upon a time, a certain person thought it would be a good idea to put up some projects on github so he wouldn't accidentally forget and wipe them off the face of the planet. Thus he built himself a secret laboratory open for the world to see, filled with fabulous toys obtained through scouring the internet and tweaked to his liking.

Current projects are primarily just aesthetic changes to the linux desktop and related projects in the form of themes.
