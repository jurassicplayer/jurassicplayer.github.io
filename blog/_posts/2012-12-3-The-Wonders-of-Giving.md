So it's once again been around two weeks thanks to the wonderful vacation that is Thanksgiving. With the fixing of my computer, everything is now working well and no overheating. Not only that, my brother has offered to let me use his USB microphone, though "offer" is not really the true situation.

In any case, with a rather nice microphone and a computer that is once again in shape, I'm just about ready to make videos :D. Of course, I still have the introduction and background music I'm planning on adding to my videos so hopefully there will be a video sooner or later...though I need to find out if I made a youtube account/channel for it.

I've recently caught up to a number of running anime series for this season as well. Sakurasou, Chuunibyou, R;N, and SAO. I also started LB!...but after watching two episodes, I can't say that I approve of the anime. I've never played the visual novel and I can't say I haven't heard word that the anime isn't as good as the visual novel. I can only hope that the visual novel is a lot better than the anime because quite frankly, I've been very disappointed. Supposedly it's a slow starting anime, but the characters are all just so very dim and while some parts were entertaining, on the whole I don't really like the anime. I'm still planning on continuing the anime, but for now it's on hold.

SAO on the other hand...MARVELOUS. The light novel was great and the anime tries to keep the important stuff in, making it all the more marvelous. It should be watched and that is all that needs to be said.

As for the things dealing with linux, I've been looking around for anything that an anime/manga lover would love to have with their linux desktop. That currently ranges from video players, music players, manga downloaders, desktop mascots, image viewers, as well as image editors. I might migrate more towards videos since it allows for people to actually see what the applications look like, rather than just say stuff about each application without any real visual. Aside from that, I've been abusing my Windows partition to play LoL most of the time (since I'd rather not go with WINE if I already have a partition for those home-made games that just don't have a linux version). Maybe my next post will have more to do with said linux applications and a video too with any luck.

With that said, I'm currently lacking in the spare time area (aren't we all?) and so I might not get to posting next week either. All annoyances should be directed towards my classes because as much as I love playing around, I need to make sure I pass my classes.
