PSP plugins are wonderfully hard to come by now that the golden age of the PSP scene has passed and so finding the latest versions of things require a bit of hunting. This list will just be the plugins I happen to think are rather convenient and for the most part, play nicely with each other.


Just a PRX:

- Hold+ v4.0: A number of features when the PSP is on hold (reduce power consumption, allow button presses after holding SELECT), adds faster music player scrolling, and a 5th brightness level.
- NoUMD 6.XX: Simply disables the UMD. Saves some power and it's not like I use the UMD slot.
- pprefs lite v1.031 (or pprefs v1.131): A handy plugin for managing your plugins in the XMB menu by pressing HOME.
- resource_block: Stops games from making images and frills when they make their saves (saves space).

- PspEtext v1.1: A nice in-game txt reader (hold L+R+X+Down to open, Select for usage) that has a forced 80 character width (for gamefaq FAQs).


PRX and More:

- Bright3 v0.02: A modified version of Bright 3 which allows you to set any number of brightness levels and their corresponding luminescence.

- Dayviewer v7: Not one I use because of my theme, but it allows for configuring the info shown on the XMB date string.

- Macrofire v3.2.9: Allows for configuring/reassigning/adjusting the buttons and joystick to how you want. Comes with an in-game menu too.

- pTextViewer: Another in-game txt viewer. This one doesn't have a 80 character width, so it's somewhat annoying, but sometimes text viewer plugins fail to run with certain games.

- StxtEditor: A txt/cfg/ini editor that can be used to view/edit text. It's not amazing, but meh.

- Joysens v1.5: Another config/reassign/adjust buttons and joystick. Seems like the default that people use.

- GameCategories lite v1.6: For organizing those emulators, games, and homebrew.

- Custom Firmware Extender v3.1: An ugly menu that allows for on-the-fly CPU speed and screen brightness changes, screen capture, remotejoy, usb mode, loading homebrew/isos over usb, listen to music, etc. It's ugly, but it has a sink of functions.

- CustomHOME v1.3.7: Changes the in-game HOME menu to one that is customizable and more useful.

- CXMB 6.XX: You need it for those really nice custom XMB themes.

- PRXShot v0.4.0 Mod: The modded version is a little more convenient, but this is a screenshot plugin.

- SystemMenu Mod (Jan-21-2015 build): Makes the VSH menu all pretty instead of the terminal text on background color.

- TempAR: A cheat engine. You shouldn't ever need it, but it's there if you do.

- XMBCtrl v1.5.5: Changes the normal system settings to amazing system settings where you can set your cfw stuff as well, like CPU speeds, iso loader, etc.

- PSPStates Menu (Pict Mod) v0.6: Only for the fancy PSPs (2000+), but allows for savestates on PSP games.

- Popsloader v4g: The latest and greatest of PSX on PSP video gaming compatibility.

- Pops_Bridge: It's required for ME/LME users in order to get Popsloader to work.
