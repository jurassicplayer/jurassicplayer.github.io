It's a brand new blog to spread the vast amounts of no knowledge that I possess in a single website that includes even the nifty stuff that I do on github every once in a blue moon.

Pretty much this is just a status update to say I'm currently moving my old posts from Blogger to my new github blog along with adding some new posts to bring all of my useless fiddling to a single place. At the moment, only the blog is really "working" and I suppose the about page can also be counted, but I still need to put up some gh-pages for my github repos, fix up how posts show up, add tags, and maybe add a nice button to the READ MORE links.

On a not completely unrelated note, I also need to remember to add that Hatsune Miku bootsplash I made some time ago for KDM. After a short while of pondering, I could probably add a MAL link to my profile on my footer as well, and hell maybe even Osu!...but I'll need to get or make some svgs for those.
