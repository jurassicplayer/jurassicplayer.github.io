It's a brand new blog to spread the vast amounts of no knowledge that I possess in a single website that includes even the nifty stuff that I do on github every once in a blue moon.

Pretty much this is just a status update to say I'm currently moving my old posts from Blogger to my new github blog along with adding some new posts to bring all of my useless fiddling to a single place. At the moment, only the blog is really "working" and I suppose the about page can also be counted, but I still need to put up some gh-pages for my github repos, fix up how posts show up, add tags, and maybe add a nice button to the READ MORE links.

On a not completely unrelated note, I also need to remember to add that Hatsune Miku bootsplash I made some time ago for KDM. After a short while of pondering, I could probably add a MAL link to my profile on my footer as well, and hell maybe even Osu!...but I'll need to get or make some svgs for those.

\-Edit 02/05/15-
Added my Snowy Night Miku KSplash theme and almost all of the posts except for the latest revisit for all of the drawing applications. Tags are added, my profile pages are linked on the bottom, and posts are for the most part looking good enough for me.

The Projects page really needs to be remade and I need to move over all of the weeb-themes stuff to the actual weeb-themes gh-pages branch (it's currently on the NekoLoliBot one). Another thought could be to reduce the size of the main content to not be able to resize so wide and make all my paragraphs look even worse. 

The artwork section also needs to have all of my terrible images added. I'll probably ditch the stuff that are just eyes or unfinished heads. No shame in my past, I'm going to need to steel myself to even post those ones that I wrote background stuff for.
