So music players are kind of a thing, unless you use your media player as your music player, which works as well, but doesn't provide the nicer functions of a music player. Of course, we are going to have a separate music player, and it is going to need to have iPod support. This pretty much equates to an iTunes replacement.

The Windows music players that are pretty popular consists of Songbird, iTunes, Spotify, Winamp, Clementine, MediaMonkey, foobar2000, and a ton of other ones that I could really care less about.

Quickly surmising reasons not to use some:
iTunes: A terrible program with bloat and is annoying to use.
Spotify: Completely useless for anime music.
Winamp: It's not bad...and it's been around for ages...but I don't like it.
Songbird: Supposedly not that heavy, but there are lighter and simpler options available
MediaMonkey: Lighter than Songbird, both in size and usage, and kind of annoying to use.
Clementine: A nice multi-platform player, but a bit about equal to Songbird in my opinion (scanning seems faster though).
Foobar2000: One of the lighter players that does what I need, and can be about as full of features or minimalistic as you want.

In other words, foobar2000 is the program of choice, but Clementine actually isn't that bad of an option either. It's pretty feature-full, has some random extras, and best of all, you can search a couple of websites like soundcloud, google drive, etc (grooveshark and some others require a premium account) which sometimes actually have anime music. The only real problem I have with it is that I hate the side panel for being so uncustomizable.
Foobar out of the box doesn't have iPod support, so the plugin as well as some things from the iTunes installer is kind of needed (Apple Mobile Device Support and Apple Application Support). Just grab the iTunes installer and extract using 7-zip or something to grab them.

Moving on to linux players, I mainly look for the lighter applications that are fairly minimalistic, so cli is my preference for playing music, but I haven't actually seen a cli music player that has iPod support. Thus I use Quod Libet which does have iPod support (need libgpod and maybe other stuff...) which is fairly light as well and suits my tastes. Otherwise it's kind of a toss up between cmus or moc in terms of cli music players since I don't really need mpd.

There are a ton of music players out there, and a variety of them are decent. Search for another one if you don't want to follow my suggestions.
