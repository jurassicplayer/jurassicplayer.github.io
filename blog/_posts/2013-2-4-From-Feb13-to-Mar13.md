Between these dates were originally 4 blog posts that I decided weren't useful enough to manually bring to this new blog. Thus instead, I'm just going to put a link to all four blog posts.

2/4/13 - [The Introduction Video](http://dev-anime.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-introduction-video.html)
2/16/13 - [Season 1 Episode 1](http://dev-anime.blogspot.com/2013/02/season-1-episode-1.html)
2/25/13 - [Season 1 Episode 2](http://dev-anime.blogspot.com/2013/02/season-1-episode-2.html)
3/10/13 - [Temporary Postponement](http://dev-anime.blogspot.com/2013/03/temporary-postponement.html)

I like how I gave up on the venture after that. It took too much effort, and IIRC I reinstalled my box without saving the stuff I used the first time.
